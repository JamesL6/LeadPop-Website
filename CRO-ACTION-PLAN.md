# LeadPop Website CRO Action Plan
**Conversion Rate Optimization Roadmap**

---

## Current Situation

**No clients yet** - LeadPop is launching fresh. No testimonials, case studies, or client logos available at this time.

**Video coming in ~2 weeks** - Will be added post-launch. Remove placeholder for now.

**Pricing is variable** - Depends on buy box criteria, lead types, filters, and volume. Cannot publish fixed prices.

---

## TODAY'S IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### 1. Fix About Page CTA Link (BUG)
- [ ] Change `index.html#book-call` → `book-call.html`
- **Files:** `about.html`

### 2. Remove "Video Coming Soon" Placeholder
- [ ] Remove the placeholder entirely from hero section
- **Files:** `index.html`

### 3. Update Hero Subtitle
- [ ] Change from current 39-word version to new 25-word version
- **New copy:** "We cover all ad spend upfront. You get exclusive, OTP-verified leads matched to your exact lending criteria — and only pay for what converts."
- **Files:** `index.html`

### 4. Add 3 New FAQ Questions
Add these to the FAQ section:

**FAQ #1: "What's the catch?"**
> The only "catch" is that we're selective — and we take all the risk. We invest our own money in ad spend upfront, so if we fail to deliver, it's entirely on us. You pay nothing unless we deliver qualified leads.
> 
> If your criteria is too narrow or your market too small for us to deliver profitably, we'll tell you that on the first call. We'd rather be honest than take you on as a client we can't deliver for.

**FAQ #2: "How much do leads cost?"**
> Pricing depends on your specific criteria — the types of loans you fund, your qualification filters, credit thresholds, revenue minimums, and monthly volume. Tighter criteria = higher quality = higher cost per lead. Broader criteria = lower cost, higher volume. We'll give you exact pricing on your strategy call once we understand your buy box.

**FAQ #3: "Why do I need to book a call for pricing?"**
> Because cookie-cutter pricing doesn't work. Your lead cost depends entirely on your lending criteria and buy box. A lender funding $50K MCAs has different needs than one doing $500K SBA loans. The call lets us understand your exact requirements so we can give you accurate pricing and realistic volume projections.

- **Files:** `index.html`, `book-call.html` (if FAQ exists there)

### 5. Host CRM Logos Locally
- [ ] Download all CRM integration logos (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, etc.)
- [ ] Save to local project folder
- [ ] Update image src paths to use local files
- **Files:** `how-it-works.html`

## URGENCY/SCARCITY OPTIONS (Choose Where to Place)

**Approved options to use:**

**Option A:** "We limit the number of partners in each market to protect lead exclusivity."

**Option C:** "We're selective about partnerships to ensure we can deliver quality for every client."

**Option F:** "We cap partnerships per region to keep your leads truly exclusive."

**Option G:** "We'd rather work with fewer lenders and deliver exceptional results than spread ourselves thin."

**Option I:** "Not every lender is a fit — and that's by design. We only partner where we know we can perform."

**Option J:** "We put our money on the line for every partner. That's why we're selective about who we work with."

**Suggested placement:** Book Call page, near calendar or in the intro section.
